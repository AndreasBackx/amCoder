Thanks for installing amCoder!


How to Activate
===============

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (âŒ˜+, on Mac).

*Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.*


Theme Settings
--------------

{
  "theme": "amCoder.sublime-theme"
}

Color-Scheme
------------

amCoder looks best with this modified version of Monokai:

{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - amCoder/amCoder.tmTheme"
}


*Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.*
